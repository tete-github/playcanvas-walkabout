# playcanvas-walkabout
work in progress!
A-Frame implementation of [the "Walkabout" XR locomotion](https://youtu.be/pW6nlLV88Zk?t=15).

Basically, you go back and forth from one end of your designated area to another and rotate the scene
when you reach the guardian boundary.

Tested on Oculus Quest 2.
Rotate by pressing the "grip" button on a controller.

[Try it yourself](https://www.timatimak.eu/experiments/playcanvas-walkabout/index.html).

[My question](https://forum.playcanvas.com/t/do-i-rotate-an-xr-camera-the-right-way/17321) about it on the Playcanvas forum
